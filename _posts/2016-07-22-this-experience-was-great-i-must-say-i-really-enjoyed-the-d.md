_This experience was great, I must say I really enjoyed the different activities. I have received the empowerment that I came into this seeking for. Everything made lots of sense. I am very grateful._

_I came in a little defeated and drained. I had a lot of self-defeating thoughts about my job performance and during our session with Malane and Ashe' I've learned I can replace and cancel those thoughts out with words of prayer using statements and words of affirmation. I learned that Dr. W supports and cares for her staff and we all are capable of so much more then we gave ourself credit for. Thank you!_

_Malane's workshop had changed my perception of myself. I learned to do a deeper soul search and figure out why I see the world the way I do. Ultimately, I learned that my perception is based on my love for myself. You should also learn to accept your humanity, embrace it and grow._

_Malane Shani Global Empowerment has made me realize so much about myself and made me understand things I need to work on, in just a short period of time. I can only imagine how life changing things would be if I had the full boot camp! Definitely worth it!_

_Wonderful experience!! Didn't have any idea of what I was getting into however, I must admit it was all worth it. I feel empowered and ready to "push through" situations and circumstances that come my way!_

_Malane and Ashe's radiant positive energy has a way of bringing out a part of yourself that you might not know is there. A little time with them is empowering and emotional and makes you want to push yourself towards visions you thought were impossible. Thank you!_

_Today's group activities help me learn more about myself and the people around me. The tools I gained from this experience I will use for the rest of my life. I'm thankful I had this chance to grow._
