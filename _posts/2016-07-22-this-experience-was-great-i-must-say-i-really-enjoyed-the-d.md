_This experience was great, I must say I really enjoyed the different activities. I have received the empowerment that I came into this seeking for. Everything made lots of sense. I am very grateful._

_I came in a little defeated and drained. I had a lot of self-defeating thoughts about my job performance and during our session with Malane and Ashe' I've learned I can replace and cancel those thoughts out with words of prayer using statements and words of affirmation. I learned that Dr. W supports and cares for her staff and we all are capable of so much more then we gave ourself credit for. Thank you!_

_Malane's workshop had changed my perception of myself. I learned to do a deeper soul search and figure out why I see the world the way I do. Ultimately, I learned that my perception is based on my love for myself. You should also learn to accept your humanity, embrace it and grow._

_Malane Shani Global Empowerment has made me realize so much about myself and made me understand things I need to work on, in just a short period of time. I can only imagine how life changing things would be if I had the full boot camp! Definitely worth it!_

_Wonderful experience!! Didn't have any idea of what I was getting into however, I must admit it was all worth it. I feel empowered and ready to "push through" situations and circumstances that come my way!_

_Malane and Ashe's radiant positive energy has a way of bringing out a part of yourself that you might not know is there. A little time with them is empowering and emotional and makes you want to push yourself towards visions you thought were impossible. Thank you!_

_Today's group activities help me learn more about myself and the people around me. The tools I gained from this experience I will use for the rest of my life. I'm thankful I had this chance to grow._

_Through my experience with Coach Malane I have had life changing results. Malane's technique and intuitiveness have supported the removal of destructive and unprofitable behavior patterns and put me on a path to realizing my goals. Malane is always there to support and answer questions when I encounter obstacles._

_Through my experience in the Activate U Now Life coaching program I stepped into my courage to leave an old way of struggle and anger behind, for a new way of freedom and ease to live my natural joy!_

_It is a true honor to have the opportunity to express how much life coaching with Coach Malane has changed my life for the best. I had an initial session with her that changed my life. I was originally excited about what would happen as I began this coaching process, however, I was also a little concerned about whether or not I would like the Real Me once I found her. After expressing this concern to Coach Malane, she laughed and told me that I would LOVE the real me and... I do!!! I love me more than I have ever loved myself in the past. I have become an example of the work I put into coaching and have recently been told by several friends that I had not seen in a while that I am glowing. They can see the changes in me by just looking at me and I love the changes. When I met Coach Malane I was ready to change my life and grow into the authentic person I am meant to be. I am so thankful to be a part of life coaching. So thankful!_

_This experience has made such a positive impact on my life that trying to describe it in words is almost impossible. Originally, I had no intentions of seeking a life coach for my personal benefit, but was seeking mediation for issues being experienced in the relationship I was in at the time. To my surprise, the mediation attempt ended up being a deep dive into my personal being on levels I never knew existed. The outcome of these sessions was an awakening to my divine self and a departure of old habits, behaviors etc. The most important thing I realized was how negative thoughts created negative energy that blocked my flow of life. This discovery alone blew my mind and gave me a new outlook on my personal life._

_I can now recognize the negative thoughts and work to turn them around. This has increased my confidence enormously, and I'm much more self-aware now. The new information gifted to me through the program allowed me to focus on my own actions VS being judgmental of what others are saying and doing. For the first time I can see myself as someone who can make an impact on this world. Her gentle guidance and strong support has led me down a path pointing me to the exact place I needed to be. ( finding myself )._

_This work has allowed me to heal years of conditioning, fear, self-doubt, over confidence, dishonesty and being detached from my emotions. She had faith in me when I had none in myself! She showed me how to have faith in myself and I am a new man because of it. Until I met Malane I was conditioned to be cold hearted& shut down when it came to my feelings. Now I realize that my emotional state needs to be stronger than my physical body in order to be the man I was called to be. _

_I began coaching with Malane Shani during a time when every step forward felt like eight going backwards. I was scared to open up to anyone and ask for help. I wanted help but I didn't want to do the work on myself. Through her persistence and love, I have done my work and found my authentic self. I am so much more aware of my abilities and talents. My sessions with Malane have not only helped me to move forward but those in my immediate family and my village of supporters._
